# Palindrome
Code to print out the palindromes froma a given string along with starting position and length.
Time complexity : O(N^2) for a string length of N. Each state is calculated using a previously calculated state.
Space Complexity: O(N^2) for a string of length N. Space is required to hold each dynamic state.
The class Palindrome as well as unit test is added. All the unit tests have passed.
The string is provided as user input.
